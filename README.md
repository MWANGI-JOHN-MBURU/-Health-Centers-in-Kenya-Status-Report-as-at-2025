##📌 Observations & Recommendations
###✅ Observations
Primary health facilities (Levels 2 and 3) account for the vast majority of centers.

There’s a substantial number of faith-based and private health facilities, highlighting the contribution of non-governmental actors.

High concentration of medical clinics and nursing homes suggests a growing demand for accessible outpatient and elderly care services.

###🔄 Recommendations
Upgrade Lower-Level Facilities
Investment is needed to upgrade Level 2 and 3A facilities to higher-capacity centers, especially in underserved counties.

Enhance Specialized Services
With limited numbers of Level 5 and specialized tertiary centers, increasing these facilities can help manage complex cases locally.

Data Integration
Continue refining health data collection to ensure accuracy in facility classification and service capacity, especially in remote areas.
